### 2FA Scenario
Private Key -> (Elliptic Curve) => Public Key -> (Hashing) => Address

## Prerequisites
List all the prerequisites that the user needs to have installed on their system before running your project. For example:
- Java JDK (version x.x.x or higher)
- Spring Boot (version x.x.x or higher)
- Maven (version x.x.x or higher)
- ...

## Installation
Provide detailed installation steps for setting up your project. Include any additional configurations or steps needed to run the project.

## Usage
Explain how to use your blockchain project. Include any relevant commands, endpoints, or user interfaces. For example:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<username>/<project-name>.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-name>`
3. Run the project: `mvn spring-boot:run`
4. Access the application: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:<port>`

## API Documentation
If your project exposes APIs, provide a link to the API documentation here. You can use tools like Swagger or Springfox to generate API documentation automatically.

## Contributing
Explain how others can contribute to your project. Include guidelines for submitting bug reports, feature requests, or pull requests. Provide information about coding standards and other practices.

## License
State the license under which your project is distributed. For example, you can use the MIT License, Apache License 2.0, etc. Make sure to add a `LICENSE` file in the repository with the full license text.

## Contact
Provide contact information (e.g., email address) for users or developers who want to get in touch with you regarding the project.
